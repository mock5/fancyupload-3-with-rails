== Welcome to fancyupload-rails

This is a an out of the box rails app with fancyupload working.

== Notes

For the entire application, protect from forgery is false.

The fancyupload scripts are copyright Harald Kirschner <http://digitarald.de>.  I downloaded the "working fancyupload installation" from his site and took the relevant pieces for a rails app.

Enjoy!
